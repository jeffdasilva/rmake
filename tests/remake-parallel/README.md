# Parallel makefile remakes

These 16 original profiles hold real recipe children until the harness observes
the make process waiting. Each release records the live children, their parent
PID and start times, and the file effects already visible. Both named workers
must be held at the first release in a parallel profile. The second release
must observe the same right worker. The serial controls require one live
worker at each release.

The success profiles compare independent required and optional include
remakes, serial `-j1`, and global `.NOTPARALLEL`. Both generated makefiles must
be loaded after one restart. The failure profiles hold two prerequisites of one
included makefile and compare the exact diagnostics, output, and order of
ordinary goal effects. Each profile runs with the pipe and FIFO jobserver.

Run the standalone gate after bootstrapping the pinned GNU Make oracle.

```sh
python3 tools/remake_parallel.py --self-test
python3 tools/remake_parallel.py --candidate target/debug/rmake --report /tmp/remake-parallel.json
```

The self-test requires two exact GNU observations and independent models for
the exit status, streams, filesystem, and release witnesses. The candidate
must match those requirements as well. To share the pinned oracle with a
sparse source checkout, pass its executable with `--oracle` and its profile
with `--oracle-profile`.

This gate stays outside `make check`, release checks, self-hosting, and CI
while parallel makefile remakes are incomplete. The merged debug baseline
`d1171e8f1` passes the four serial controls and fails all twelve parallel
profiles. The observer releases a single genuinely held child when the engine
waits serially so those mismatches can be diagnosed without timing out.
